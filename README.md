# GeneAnalysis
This project analyses different aspects of the gene presented in the program. The project: calculates the ATGC percentage, counts the dinucleotides, counts the trinucleotides, gets the AT content, writes the exons into a separate file, writes the introns into a separate file, find the starting position of the ATG, translates the coding sequence, and finds mutations in the gene.
