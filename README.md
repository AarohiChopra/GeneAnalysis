# GeneAnalysis
This project analyses different aspect of the gene presented in the program.
The project :
calculates the ATGC percentage, 
counts the dinucleotides,
counts the trinucleotides,
gets the AT content,
writes the exons into a seperate file, 
writes the introns into a seperate file, 
find the starting position of the ATG,
translates the coding sequence,
and finds mutations in the gene.
